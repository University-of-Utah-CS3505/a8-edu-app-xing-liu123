Specifically, clownfish are found in the Indian Ocean – they don’t exist in the Atlantic. Here, they occur, among other places, in the Red Sea, the Pacific and the famous Australian Great Barrier reef. In many cases, they can be spotted while diving, because they favor shallow reef areas. That’s where they find their natural hosts: a few specific species of anemone.
